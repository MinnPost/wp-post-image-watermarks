# WP Post Image Watermarks

Our supplemental member-only content requires users to be a Silver member or above, but these posts also sometimes get listed in other places (on the homepage, in email newsletters, sometimes in sidebars).

This plugin works like this:

1. When a thumbnail image is uploaded to an article, check if the article has a member level restriction on it.
2. If it does, check which icon style is selected in the meta fields.
3. Put the corresponding MP+ png on top of the image in the applicable sizes, position it, and save it.
